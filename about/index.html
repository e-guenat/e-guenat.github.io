			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am curently doctoral assistant at the Laboratory for Applied Mechanical Design (LAMD). My research focuses on aerodynamic bearings, advance design methodologies and non-ideal gas effect in thin viscous flows. I use part of my spare time to advocate against light pollution as a board member of the NGO Dark-Sky Switzerland. As an after-PhD adventure, I will bike from Lyon (France) to Guangzhou (China) with a solar-powered bike in 2020, as a participant to the Sun Trip. You will soon find some info on this topic in the dedicated section. </p>
